Pavlov VR released WWII tanks this year. The Push mode is on its way and will be released later. For this reason, I planned on adding some artillery anti-tank guns and sharing it with map creators.

Actually, the pack contains four models of the most famous heavy anti-tanks guns of the World War 2:

GERMAN:
Flak-36, "Flak 88"
Pak-40

US:
QF-6 Pounder

SOVIET:
ZiS-2
